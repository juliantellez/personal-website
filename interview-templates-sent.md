Hi Alex,

Thanks for thinking of me for this role!
I am currently exploring new opportunities,
but would ideally like to find a position that would allow me to
continue working within the AWS space.
This is because I feel like most of the value/impact I can provide would be initially disrupted.
As a Serverless shop observability and monitoring strategies are paramount
and I lack such experience within the Google Cloud space.

Thanks again and let's stay in touch
