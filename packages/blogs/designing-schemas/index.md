title: Designing Schemas
---

# What is a schema

# Why do we design schemas
- Resilience
- Extensibility
- Easy to reason about
- Model an interface to the business domain

# Why GraphQL
 - a type system to express possibilities
 - Declarative, client select what they want and nothing more

# Graph data structure?

Notes:

- Stop thinking REST - Start thinking graphs
- Stop thinking endpoints - Start thinking how to model data
- Don't design data around UI, components views - Design data around use cases
