Tell me how you organize and prioritize your work?

I organize my work on a Daily, Weekly and Fortnightly basis

Daily identify urgent vs important.
typically code reviews as it usually unblocks co workers,
other tasks include white boarding and pair-programming.

Meetings and catchups are usually done in the afternoon.

Weekly, I Order work by estimated effort and try to identify BUDs
Bootle necks
Unnecessary work
Duplicated work

Fortnightly, Monthly set the new goal or milestone,
typically done with the whole team.

Tell me about a presentation you have given to a client that you are proud of.

A presentation on KPIs, and why observability is important
A presentation on Continuous Delivery and why do we needed
